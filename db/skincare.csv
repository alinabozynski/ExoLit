Ingredient Callouts: These products are vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free.

What Else You Need to Know: The Squalane Cleanse is formulated to clean skin by removing makeup and dirt. This cleanser also supports your skin’s moisture barrier through hydration. Its skin-cleansing properties harness plant-derived squalane, a well-studied moisturizing agent, alongside lipophilic esters that will leave your skin feeling smooth and soft while dissolving makeup. The formula is non-comedogenic and soap-free so it’s gentle enough for daily use, suitable for all skin types, and suitable to combine with our other products.

The Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serumis a hydrator that smooths and plumps with hyaluronic acid. It is a water-based formula combining low-, medium- and high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid molecules and an advanced HA crosspolymer to support hydration to the skin. It also targets the appearance of wrinkles and textural irregularities. Plus, it uses pro-vitamin B5 to enhance hydration, resulting in smoother, plumper skin.

The Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a moisturizer that works with your skin to support its natural hydration barrier. By using a collection of ingredients that appear naturally in your skin—such as amino acids, fatty acids, triglycerides, urea, ceramides, phospholipids, glycerine, saccharides, sodium PCA, and hyaluronic acid—this cream keeps the outer layer of your skin protected and well-hydrated, without feeling greasy. Plus, it provides both immediate and lasting effects, as it works to significantly improve skin barrier function with regular use.

This Set Contains:
- 5 oz/ 150 mL Squalane Cleanser
- 2 oz/ 60 mL Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum
